        <p>Hello, I’m Novoa Champion, a Towson University graduate with 10 years of professional 
            experience in web design, working both as a freelancer and within office environments. 
            My experience includes collaborating with the law office of Scott Magers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 
            and Debra Holt’s art gallery in Miami, Florida. I have a passion for learning and staying at the 
            forefront of technology, constantly seeking opportunities to collaborate with talented developers to 
            bring innovative ideas to life. Outside of tech, I’m a dedicated flutist, performing with the Anitas 
            Flutes and the Baltimore Flute Choir. </p>

<p>If you’re looking for a creative problem solver with a strong work ethic and a drive for excellence, feel 
    free to reach out. I look forward to connecting!</p>
